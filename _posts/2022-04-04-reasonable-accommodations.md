The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provides reasonable accommodations to qualified employees and job applicants with disabilities where appropriate. Employees and job applicants requiring reasonable accommodations should contact [Talaya Clay](mailto:claytr@mcc.gov?subject=Reasonable%20Accommodations%20at%20MCC) or [Lavetta Young](mailto:Youngl@mcc.gov?subject=Reasonable%20Accommodations%20at%20MCC). Determinations on requests for reasonable accommodations will be made on a case-by-case basis.

A reasonable accommodation is any change to a job, the work environment, or the way things are usually done that enables an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform job duties or receive equal access to job benefits.

<p>Under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodations when:</p>
<ol>
<li>An applicant with a disability needs an accommodation to have an equal opportunity to apply for a job.</li>
<li>An employee with a disability needs an accommodation to perform the essential job duties or to gain access to the workplace.</li>
<li>An employee with a disability needs an accommodation to receive equal access to benefits, such as details, training, and office-sponsored events.</li>
</ol>
